# Setup

`lightMLFlow` is not on CRAN. You can install it from Github as follows:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("mrkaye97/lightMLFlow")
```

# The package

This package differs from the CRAN `mlflow` package in a few important ways. 

First, there are some things that the full CRAN `mlflow` package has that this package doesn't:

* `mlflow` supports more configurable artifact stores, while `lightMLFlow` only supports S3 as the artifact store.
* `mlflow` allows you to run `install_mlflow()` to install MLFlow on your machine. `lightMLFlow` assumes you already have `MLFlow` installed. (In other words, there's no `install_mlflow()` function in this package).
* `mlflow` lets you run the MLFlow UI directly from the package, which `lightMLFlow` does not. `lightMLFlow` is made to be used with a deployed MLFlow instance, which means that your instance needs to already exist (either on local on on a cloud server).

However, there are also significant advantages to using `lightMLFlow` over `mlflow`:

* `lightMLFlow` features a friendlier API, with significantly fewer functions, no `mlflow::mlflow_*` function prefixing (following Tidyverse conventions, `lightMLFlow` function names are verbs), and improved error handling.
* `lightMLFlow` fixes some bugs in `mlflow`'s API wrapping functions.
* `lightMLFlow` is significantly more lightweight than `mlflow`. It doesn't depend on `httpuv`, `reticulate`, or `swagger`, and has a far more minimal footprint in general.
* `lightMLFlow` uses `aws.s3` to put and save objects to and from S3, which means you don't need to have a `boto3` install on your machine running your `MLFlow` code. This is an essential change, as it means that `lightMLFlow` does not require _any_ Python infrastructure, as opposed to `mlflow`, which does.


## Future Work

A couple goals for this package as it matures:

1. Supporting `Tidymodels` model formats in `save_model` and `log_model`. Since `Tidymodels` provides a uniform API for modeling, it should play nicely with `MLFlow` by allowing us to save an arbitrary model in `.rds` format (as long as a `predict` method exists), and then load the `.rds` file and use `predict(model, data)` when serving the model.
