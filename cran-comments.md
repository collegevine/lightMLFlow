* This is a new release.
* The objective of this package is to provide a far more lightweight, user-friendly wrapper for the MLFlow REST API than the `mlflow` package provides. It is not nearly as fully-fledged, but if you have an MLFlow use case that relies on S3 for artifact storage and are intending to deploy models as `{{plumber}}` or `{{restRServe}}` APIs, or you just want to use MLFlow and have an instance deployed somewhere, this package might be a great fit for your needs without the additional bloat.
