Description: This package provides a lightweight R wrapper for the MLFlow
    REST API. It makes some assumtions (notably, that you already have
    MLFlow installed wherever this package is being used), but, in return,
    you get some benefits: A simpler API, not needing `reticulate`,
    relying on `aws.s3` where possible, etc.
