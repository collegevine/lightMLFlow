Description: 'MLFlow' <https://www.mlflow.org/> is an open-source tool for tracking, versioning, and
    deploying machine learning models. This package provides a lightweight
    R wrapper for the 'MLFlow' REST API <https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/rest-api.html>. It makes some assumptions (notably,
    that you already have an 'MLFlow' instance running, you want to use S3
    for artifact storage, and you intend to deploy models in an (e.g.)
    'plumber' API), but, in return, you get some benefits: A simpler API,
    not needing 'reticulate', relying on 'aws.s3' where possible, etc.
